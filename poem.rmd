They know that she always does her best.    
    
A virtuous woman does all that she can,    
She’s always there and stands by her man.    
Though she’s humble and meek, she takes no mess,    
You can count on her to pass the test.    
    
You will know her when she passes you by,    
For she always holds her head up high.    
She’s courageous and strong, a dignified lady she is,    
You will never know that she has shed many tears.      
    
A lady of class and elegance too,      
She will let you know what you will need to do,         
To come up to her standard, which is very high.      
For she is headed for her home in the sky.
